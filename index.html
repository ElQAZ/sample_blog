                            With your budget in mind, it is easy to plan a chartered yacht vacation. Companies often have a
                            fleet of sailing vessels that can accommodate parties of various sizes. You may want to make it
                            a more intimate trip with only close family. There are charters that can be rented for as few as
                            two people. These include either a sailboat or motorboat and can come with or without a crew and
                            captain to sail the ship for you. If you choose not to hire a crew, you will have to show that
                            you are knowledgeable of sailing and can handle the ship competently.

                            The next part of planning is to determine your starting and ending ports. This could be a place
                            close to home and sail in one area or start and finish at two different ports. Generally,
                            starting and stopping in the same port will save you money and is usually more convenient. You
                            can also fly to a destination far from home and then sail another exotic sea. There are luxury
                            yacht charter companies that cruise the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas or around Alaska, the
                            Panama Canal, or anyplace you can imagine.

                            Determining the type of cruise is another aspect of planning a chartered yachting trip. You can
                            have as little or many crew members as the ship will hold. A captain takes all the worries out
                            of navigating and onboard housekeeping services make it a real vacation that rivals the finest
                            hotel services. You can also choose to have a chef and service crew as part of your vacation
                            package.
